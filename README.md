A menu-based RPG of infinite possibilities.

## Notes
* Should be playable with the keyboard alone
  * Figure out 'tabindex' and getting focus
  * If focus lost, pause
* Mini-choose-your-own-adventure scenarios and random events can be incorporated
* Town section also possible (items, healing, quests, easter eggs, etc)
